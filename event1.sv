//The wait_order construct is blocking the process until all of the specified events are triggered in the given order (left to right)
//event trigger with out of order will not unblock the process.
//wait(ev,ev1,ev2) Blocks the process until events a, b, and c trigger in the order ev â€“> ev1 â€“> ev2. If the events trigger out of order, a run-time error is generated.
